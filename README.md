# ML_Regression_covid19_gold
"This is my personal data science project completely built in Python in which I study the relationship "
                "between Covid19 new cases and the price of the gold in the NYSE. "
                "In this project I'm using Supervised Machine Learning models to predict a continuous variable, "
                "in this case, Gold close price. "
                "I'm utilizing the pandas, scikit-learn, numpy and yahoo_fin libraries to collect, explore and "
                "pre-process data used in building machine learning models. "
                "For this particular regression problem, I'm comparing the five most commonly used regression models "
                "according to their prediction accuracy. "
                "In the final step of the project, I'm using the Dash Plotly library to show gained insights to the "
                "end-user. "
